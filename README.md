```lrc
[00:06.64] I'm packin' my bags that I didn't unpack the last time
[00:12.61] I'm sayin', "See you again," so many times, it's becoming my tagline
[00:19.49] But you know the truth, I'd rather hold you
[00:22.65] Than try to catch this flight
[00:25.82] So many things I'd rather say
[00:27.82] But for now, it's goodbye
[00:40.32] 
[00:32.84] You say I'm always leavin'
[00:38.98] You, when you're sleepin' alone
[00:43.94] But the, the car's outside
[00:47.28] But I don't wanna go tonight
[01:01.28] 
[00:51.94] I'm not gettin' in the Addison Lee
[00:57.24] Unless you pack your bags
[01:00.89] You're comin' with me
[01:05.60] I'm tired of lovin' from afar
[01:08.85] And never being where you are
[01:12.24] Close the windows, lock the doors
[01:15.11] Don't wanna leave you anymore
[01:29.61] 
[01:19.53] Oh-oh, ah
[01:24.03] 
[01:23.46] I'm starin' at the same four walls in a different hotel
[01:30.05] It's an unfamiliar feelin' but I know it so well
[01:35.75] Oh, but you know the truth, I'd rather hold you
[01:39.40] Than this mobile in my hand
[01:42.56] But I guess it'll do, 'cause for you
[01:45.10] I would run up my phone bill
[01:59.10] 
[01:49.19] You say I'm always leavin'
[01:55.56] You, when you need me the most
[02:00.88] But the, the car's outside
[02:04.07] But I don't wanna go tonight
[02:18.07] 
[02:08.72] I'm not gettin' in the Addison Lee
[02:13.92] Unless you pack your bags
[02:17.87] You're comin' with me
[02:22.16] I'm tired of lovin' from afar
[02:25.45] And never being where you are
[02:29.06] Close the windows, lock the doors
[02:32.01] Don't wanna leave you anymore
[02:46.51] 
[02:34.66] Ooh-ooh, ah
[02:37.88] Ooh-ooh, ah
[02:40.96] Ooh-ooh, ah
[02:44.75] Don't wanna leave you anymore
[02:59.25] 
[02:47.93] Oh, darling, all of the city lights
[02:51.04] Never shine as bright as your eyes
[02:54.20] I would trade them all for a minute more
[02:57.48] But the car's outside
[02:59.14] And he's called me twice
[03:01.69] But he's gonna have to wait tonight
[03:19.19] 
[03:06.13] I'm not gettin' in the Addison Lee
[03:11.48] Unless you pack your bags
[03:15.31] You're comin' with me
[03:19.86] I'm tired of lovin' from afar
[03:23.15] And never being where you are
[03:26.46] Close the windows, lock the doors
[03:29.52] Don't wanna leave you anymore
[03:44.02] 
[03:32.95] Ooh-ooh, ah
[03:36.13] Ooh-ooh, ah
[03:39.32] Ooh-ooh, ah
[03:41.94] No, I don't wanna leave you anymore
[03:59.44] 
[03:45.30] (Ooh-ooh, ah) I don't wanna leave you
[03:48.70] (Ooh-ooh, ah) I don't wanna leave you
[03:51.71] (Ooh-ooh, ah) I don't wanna leave you
[03:55.22] Don't wanna leave you anymore
